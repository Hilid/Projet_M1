\section*{Abstract}


This study is about sound propagation in periodic structures, focusing on the specific example of a waveguide, periodically loaded by Helmholtz resonators, taking into account viscothermal losses (distributed in the duct and localised at each resonator). Research on resonant acoustic meta-materials is closely linked to works on lattice in the fields of electromagnetism and crystallography.\\

This kind of structures is used for its ability to create a dispersive medium. Indeed, two kinds of phenomenon unable the wave transmission at some frequencies through the lattice. Some gaps are due to resonators which absorb the energy at frequencies near their resonances. Other frequency gaps, called Bragg gaps, are created by the periodicity of the structure that localises waves for which the wave length is twice the distance between two resonators.\\

Theoretical works and numerical simulations are presented in this report in order to describe the frequency response for finite, infinite, disordered and ordered lattice.\\


Then, using the dispersion relation of the system and introducing a defect on the cavity length of one resonator, a phenomenon of localised wave is studied numerically and observed experimentally. For this purpose, the choice of the defect resonance frequency and its position in the lattice is carefully considered. If the defect resonates in a frequency gap, the pressure wave resulting from this resonance cannot propagate and is restricted in the vicinity of the defect. \\
