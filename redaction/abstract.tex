%intro : interet, problematique, contexte 
This study is about sound propagation in periodic structures, focusing on the case of a guide, periodically loaded by Helmholtz resonators, taking in account losses. The work on resonant acoustic meta-materials is closely linked to those in electromagnetism and in crystallography on lattice.\\~\\ %Historically, research on lattice has been more developed in this two field than in acoustics%historiquement, c'est ces deux derniers domaines dans lequel ça a été développé, donc moins en acoustique

This kind of structures is used for its ability to create a dispersive medium. Indeed, some frequencies passing through the lattice are absorbed for two reasons. One reason is that resonators absorb the energy at the frequencies near theirs resonances. Other frequency gaps, called Bragg gaps, are created by the periodicity that localise waves for witch the wave length is twice the distance between two resonators.\\~\\

Theoretical works and numerical simulations are leaded in this report in order to describe the frequency response for finite, infinite, disordered and ordered lattice. 

Then, using this dispersion and introducing a defect on one of the resonators, a phenomenon of localised wave is studied numerically and observed experimentally. For this purpose, the choice of the resonance frequency of the defect and its position in the lattice is carefully considered. If the defect resonate at a frequency cut by the lattice, the pressure wave generated cannot propagate and is restricted in the vicinity of the defect.\\~\\
